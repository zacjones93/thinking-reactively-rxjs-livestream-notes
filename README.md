Some question(s) are outlined in the essential questions section of the README for you to think about as you take the workshop. There is no 'definitive' answer to these questions but as you learn, you'll develop a more contextualized answer.

Right below is the intended outcomes of the course, these are the skills and knowledge you will learn that you can take to any application to use.

## Essential Questions
    What problems are best solved reactively?
    How can I best extract this problem into a reactive solution?
    How can I connect imperative code with the streams I’m building?
    How should abstractions be named?

## Outcomes:

- Identify a problem
- See why rxjs would be a good solution
- Think about how to solve with RxJS
- Neatly wrap our code so it can be used anywhere
- Learn some operators along the way.
  - combineLatest, timer, delay, scan, takeUntil, skipWhile, distinctUntilChanged, shareReplay, etc.



## 01. Overview

RxJS is really good at certain problems - makes it easy to read and extensible - harder to mess up

RxJS needs upfront thought on the design of the code to make it becom as extensible and beautiful as possible

The notes in this repository are broken down into 3 sections:   
- Requirements and problem solving
- Notes taken during the livestream
- Viewer questions
